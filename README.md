The README contains only a brief overview of our goals, investigation process, analysis, and recommendations.
For detailed documentation/analysis/findings, please refer to our final presentation[https://github.com/sallylee0801/Hospitality-Cancellation-Rate-Prediction/blob/main/Hospitality%20Cancellation%20Rate%20Prediction.pdf] and report.
## Business Objective
We aim to leverage historical data, consider consumer behavior and external factors, and implement machine learning to increase cancellation rate prediction accuracy, optimize hotel resource allocation, and maximize revenue.
## Data Sources
We utilized hotel booking data from ScienceDirect website[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.11.126 ], economic indicator data from IMF [https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=61545849], weather data from Visual Crossing [https://www.visualcrossing.com/], and tourist data from Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica [https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=10822#!tabs-table].
